# VanillAI

## Introduction

**VanillAI** is a deep learning and machine learning framework built entirely from scratch using pure Python ‚Äî no third-party dependencies. This lightweight, minimalistic framework allows for full control over the development of neural networks and machine learning models without relying on pre-built libraries. 

Starting out, this repo will try to replicate entire [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library by a vanilla approach.

After scikit implementation, I will decide on a DL framework to replicate and will update future log accordingly.

As the project continues, the future log will be updated.

## Installation

Since **VanillAI** has no dependencies, there is no need to install anything. Simply clone the repository and start building your own models.

    git clone https://github.com/batuhaneralp/vanillai
    cd vanillai

Simple as that üí™üèª

## Acknowledgments

-   **Pure Python**: This project was made possible by the simplicity and power of Python.
    
-   **Educational Purpose**: This framework was built with the goal of providing a deeper understanding of deep learning and machine learning principles.

-   **Bragging Rights**: I will personally look back at this and will tell myself, "well I did it". I will probably buy myself a bottle of celebratory wine and pat myself on the back and continue my crippling imposter syndrome.
